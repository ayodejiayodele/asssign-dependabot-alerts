# assign-dependabot-alerts

This repository contains an action workflow called `assign-dependabot-alerts.yml`. This workflow is designed to automate the process of assigning Dependabot alerts to specific individuals or teams within your project.

## How it works

When triggered, the `assign-dependabot-alerts.yml` workflow performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves the list of Dependabot alerts for your repository.
2. Filters the alerts based on certain criteria, such as severity level or package manager.
3. Assigns the filtered alerts to the specified individuals or teams.
4. Notifies the assigned individuals or teams about the newly assigned alerts.

This workflow helps streamline the management of Dependabot alerts by automatically assigning them to the appropriate individuals or teams responsible for addressing them. By doing so, it ensures that the alerts are promptly addressed and reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities or outdated dependencies in your project.

## Usage

To use this action workflow in your own project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the contents of the `assign-dependabot-alerts.yml` file into your repository's `.github/workflows` directory.
2. Customize the workflow as needed, such as specifying the individuals or teams to assign the alerts to.
3. Commit and push the changes to your repository.

Once the workflow is set up, it will automatically run whenever new Dependabot alerts are generated for your repository, ensuring that the appropriate individuals or teams are assigned to address them.

For more information on how to configure and customize this action workflow, please refer to the documentation provided in the `assign-dependabot-alerts.yml` file.
